# CS465-Full-Stack-Development

<b>Compare and contrast the types of frontend development you used in your full stack project, including Express HTML, JavaScript, and the single-page application (SPA).</b>
<p>  Express is the web framework for node.js that is designed to perform tasks in a well-tested and repeatable way. It sets up a web server for incoming requests and returns relevant responses.
Express also defines a directory structure. Furthermore, Express uses sessions so that you can identify visitors thorugh multiple pages and requests.</p>
<p>  JavaScript is the language that makes up the MEAN stack. This allows coding of the frontend and backend with the same language. We use JavaScript in BSON which is how MongoDB stores documents for us to apply CRUD operations with. Furthermore, the use of Angular in our stack is made up of a JavaScript framework for creating interfaces in our application.</p>
